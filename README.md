# UI-Luncher-2

### An app that gives schools and communities to work together to provide school lunches to students of families who are unable to afford them on a regular basis.

## Getting Started

  *Schools sign up and create a profile to gain access to a dashboard that allows them to setup a list and donation goal.

  *People can donate anonymously or by creating a profile if they'd like to track their donations through the app.  Donors can donate to a   single school or multiple schools in a single transaction.

  *Schools will be notified when a donation has been made and when funding is available.

## Social Media

  *Follow on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter to keep up with ongoing news with the app and to give feedback.
